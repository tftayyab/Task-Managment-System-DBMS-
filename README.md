# Task Management System

## 📌 Overview

This is a **Task Management System** built during a software development internship project. It allows users to create, edit, delete, and manage tasks efficiently. The system includes advanced features such as:

## ✅ Features

- **CRUD Operations** for Tasks  
- **User Authentication** with **JWT** and **bcrypt** password hashing  
- **Search and Filter** tasks by status and keywords  
- **Task Progress Tracking** with visual indicators
- **Dark Mode** with interactive visuals
- **Enhance Tasks with AI** 
- Responsive UI with modern styling  
- Backend & frontend **API integration**  
- Basic **unit testing** for quality assurance  

---

## 🧰 Tech Stack

### Backend
- **Node.js**  
- **Express.js**  
- **MySQL** (e.g. Railway-hosted)  
- **Joi** (Validation)  
- **JWT** (Authentication)  
- **Google Gemini** (Enhance Tasks with AI)
- **Socket.io** (Real time Teams and Tasks Notifications)
-  **bcrypt** (Password hashing for security)

> Passwords are never stored in plain text. During registration, passwords are hashed using **bcrypt** before saving to the database, and during login, bcrypt compares the entered password with the stored hash to ensure secure authentication.

### Frontend
- **React.js**  
- **Axios** (API calls)  
- **Tailwind CSS** (Styling)
- **Chart.js** (Dashboards Charts Styling)
